## 1- Profile
Hey there, I'm Adolfo, a Forestry Engineer and Anthropologist from Brazil. I'm passionate about quantitative forestry and social sciences, and I love working on GIS problems and spatial modeling.

I'm a problem-solving pro who loves to tackle complex scenarios and find nature-based solutions to secure financial resources to fight against the climate change crisis. My superpowers are technical carbon issues, REDD+ projects, agroforestry, and agriculture land management (ALM). I have more than five years of experience in afforestation and reforestation (AR), especially associated with the voluntary carbon market under VCS, CCBs, and GS.

I have a solid technical background in social and biodiversity, environmental and governance impact assessment, and I have participated in coordinating the development of several AFOLU projects in Latin America, and I've also contributed to some projects in Africa.

When I'm not crunching data, leading projects, or engaging stakeholders, I like to improve my English and Portuguese skills. I also speak Spanish, and I'm proficient in both languages.

But don't let my serious skills and dedication to my work fool you—I also have many flaws, some of which are silly, chaotic, funny, and even awful.

Currently, I am Regional Lead, in Nature Base Solutions, Climate Projects - LatAm at South Pole.
