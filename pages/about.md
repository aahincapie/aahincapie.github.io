## 1- Profile
I am Adolfo, a Forestry Engineer and Anthropologist from Colombia with a Master in Analysis and Modeling of Environmental Systems from Brazil. I am passionate about quantitative forestry and social sciences, and I love working on GIS problems and spatial modeling.

I am a problem-solving pro with a proven track record in tackling complex scenarios and finding nature-based solutions to secure financial resources to fight against the climate change crisis. My superpowers are GIS and technical carbon issues related to REDD+ projects and agroforestry. My technical expertise in GIS modeling and social and impact assessment has enabled me to coordinate the development of several AFOLU projects in Latin America and Africa. When I'm not crunching data or managing projects, I like to improve my English and Portuguese skills. I also speak Spanish (mother tongue). I have more than five years of experience associated with the voluntary carbon market, especially under VCS, CCBs, and GS.

I am currently a Regional Lead for Nature-Based Solutions and Climate Projects in Latin America at South Pole. I enjoy using my skills and experience to help South Pole and Projects to achieve their mission of making a positive impact on the planet.

## 7- References

### Academic references

I have had the opportunity to share closely with incredible people in the public, private and academic sectors.

I highlight the role in my bachelor carrer of a Antropologist **Rober Dover** who pass away. Robert teaches me soft skills to work with traditional communities. [Who was he?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev8FddReiPk&t=69s),

I highlight the fact to had the possibility of having a classroom with ones of those teachers that think outside the black box and always are in the knowledge frontier:
