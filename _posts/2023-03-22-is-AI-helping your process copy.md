## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the transformer architecture, which allows it to generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence. ChatGPT is trained on a massive corpus of text, allowing it to generate high-quality, natural-sounding text in response to a given prompt.

## The Capacity for Summarization

One of the most impressive features of ChatGPT is its capacity for summarization. Summarization is the process of condensing a large amount of text into a shorter summary that captures the main points. ChatGPT is capable of generating high-quality summaries of text, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and content creation.

ChatGPT's summarization capacity is made possible by its ability to understand the context of a given text. It can identify the most important sentences and phrases in a document and use them to generate a summary that accurately captures the main points.

## The Capacity for Table Creation and Analysis

In addition to its capacity for summarization, ChatGPT also has the ability to create tables for data analysis. This is a valuable feature for businesses and researchers who need to analyze large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

ChatGPT's table creation and analysis capacity is made possible by its ability to understand the structure of data. It can identify patterns and relationships in data and present them in a clear and concise format. This makes it easy for users to analyze and interpret the data, allowing them to make informed decisions based on the insights gained.

## Chatgpt instructions to identify priorities in avaluations:



Here are some instructions to start.

`You are a professional quality control reviewer of carbon projects. A new report by the advocacy group said the offset was altering long-standing Indigenous herding practices and couldn’t accurately account for how much carbon it was removing from the atmosphere. Say okay if you understand the instruction`
> Okay

Following give some context for ChatGPT:

`The report brings the context the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) and highlight some issues https://news.mongabay.com/2023/03/carbon-credits-from-award-winning-kenyan-offset-suspended-by-verra/ Say okay if you understand the instruction`
> Okay

Lets do to a pause here, Chatgpt is lazy but effective, may be i just goig to the firts six paragraphs of the reading, and they take some seed to do his conclusions.

I Suggest give enought context, extract by yourself the main ideas, main problems, and put into the chat.

### A first outcome for summarization:

`Create a table/list to summarize the main problems with the monitoring in NRT Carbon Offset Project, 10 minimal rows, // Your can also define other topics.`

Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.

The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.

The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?

We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.
