'For Transparency lover' 

The NBS finance holds great potential. In recent years, interest in investments tied to nature — such as net zero, carbon credits and biodiversity offsets — has grown rapidly. Despite a vibrant ecosystem of NGOs, funds, and developers, **nature markets like the voluntary carbon market (VCM)** have stagnated under $2 billion since 2021.

One key reason? **Lack of trust**, fueled by **conflicts of interest**.

## ⚠️ What Are Conflicts of Interest in NBS Market Stakeholders?

These misaligned incentives often go undetected but profoundly influence project credibility and investment willingness. Here's a table summarizing the major types:

| **Actor**                        | **Conflict of Interest**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standards & Registries           | Paid per credit issued → Incentive to approve more projects, regardless of quality        |
| Validators & Verifiers           | Paid by project developers → Bias toward “pleasing” or retention clients instead of rigorous review    |
| Rating Agencies                  | Paid by investor and developers → Incentive to inflate ratings to attract more business or focus review                |
| Brokers / Market Intermediaries | Provide buyer guidance while earning commissions → Biased advice                          |
| Project Developers               | Paid per credit → Incentivized to find loopholes and inflate credit volume                |
| Self-Assessments                 | Developers analyze their own projects → "Marking their own homework"                      |
| Carbon experts               | Experts analyze their own projects → "Marking others homework and inflating bad projects"                      |
| Model experts             | Modellers are contracted by projects/VVBs to validate own models → "Marking others homework, acting as a independent modeling expert (IME) looking to inflating project estimations"                      |
| Methodology Authors              | Developers write own standards → Incentivized to lower requirements for easier approval   |

## 🔍 Why It Matters

- These dynamics evolved unintentionally in a young market lacking mature governance.
- Oversight is weak — **journalists**, not auditors, often serve as the primary watchdogs.
- Even the **appearance** of bias erodes confidence.
- Result: capital stays on the sidelines.

## 🛠 How to Build Trust

To unlock nature investment, we must **acknowledge, expose, and change** these dynamics:

### 1. 🌞 Radical Transparency
- Encourage open conversation about conflicts.
- Add **conflict-of-interest notices** to every transaction.

### 2. 🕵️ Independent Due Diligence
- Buyers, not suppliers, must fund verification.
- Independence is key to unbiased risk assessment.

### 3. 🔁 Rethink Incentive Structures

| **Recommended Action**                                                           | **Goal**                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Certifiers avoid per-credit payment models                                       | Reduce bias toward high-volume approval |
| Buyers select and fund verification bodies                                       | Create independence                     |
| Developers use third-party, independent assessors only                          | Avoid self-marking                      |
| Standard-setters assign verifiers randomly                                      | Avoid cherry-picking favorable reviews  |
| Method authors cannot be project proponents                                     | Ensure neutral methodology              |
| Ratings funded by buyers                                                        | Prevent inflated scores                 |

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

**transparency and trust are prerequisites for unlocking nature-positive capital flows**.

> Until trust becomes the norm, capital will stay on the sidelines. But if trust is abundant, capital will flow — and nature will thrive.
