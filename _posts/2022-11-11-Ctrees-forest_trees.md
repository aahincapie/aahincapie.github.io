Release: At #COP27, CTrees is a platform to track carbon in every tree and forest on the planet.

- 🌲 CTrees has launched free 
- 🌿 Carbon data stocks incl. trees outside forests
- 🌍 Open data on forest carbon in all countries and jurisdictions for 2001-2021.

*Potential Uses*  
- For countries with robust forest carbon inventories, CTrees’ annual data promise help increase the frequency and efficacy of national-level reporting.
- The data also provides governments without measurement tools the info to fully assess emissions reduction efforts.
- Data could reveals a quantitative measure of forest #degradation from logging and fire.
- Carbon in trees outside forests are an important and often overlooked natural resource that contributes substantially to dry forest in many regions. For instance in Africa, CTrees reveals that one-third of all trees are located outside areas classified as forests — together with sparse savanna woodlands and dry forests, and they contain more than 60b tons of CO2e, roughly equivalent to the amount of carbon stored in Africa's rainforest areas.
