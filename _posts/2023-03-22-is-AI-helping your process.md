## Introduction

In today's world, data is abundant and readily available, but analyzing and summarizing it can be a challenge. This is where ChatGPT comes in. ChatGPT is a language model created by OpenAI that has the ability to summarize and create tables for data analysis. In this blog post, we will explore the capacities of ChatGPT for both summarization and table creation.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the transformer architecture, which allows it to generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence. ChatGPT is trained on a massive corpus of text, allowing it to generate high-quality, natural-sounding text in response to a given prompt.

## The Capacity for Summarization

One of the most impressive features of ChatGPT is its capacity for summarization. Summarization is the process of condensing a large amount of text into a shorter summary that captures the main points. ChatGPT is capable of generating high-quality summaries of text, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and content creation.

ChatGPT's summarization capacity is made possible by its ability to understand the context of a given text. It can identify the most important sentences and phrases in a document and use them to generate a summary that accurately captures the main points.

## The Capacity for Table Creation and Analysis

In addition to its capacity for summarization, ChatGPT also has the ability to create tables for data analysis. This is a valuable feature for businesses and researchers who need to analyze large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

ChatGPT's table creation and analysis capacity is made possible by its ability to understand the structure of data. It can identify patterns and relationships in data and present them in a clear and concise format. This makes it easy for users to analyze and interpret the data, allowing them to make informed decisions based on the insights gained.

## Chatgpt instructions to identify priorities in avaluations:

> You are a professional quality control reviewer of carbon projects. A new report by the advocacy group Survival International said the offset was altering long-standing Indigenous herding practices and couldn’t accurately account for how much carbon it was removing from the atmosphere. Say okay if you understand the instruction
-prints 'Okay' to STDOUT.


Put some context for:

>The report brings the context the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) and highlight some monitoring issues: https://news.mongabay.com/2023/03/carbon-credits-from-award-winning-kenyan-offset-suspended-by-verra/ Say okay if you understand the instruction

Here is a problem, maybe Chatgpt is not reading all the article, they take some seed and print

Put the first outcome for:

>Create a table to summarize the main problems with the monitoring in NRT Carbon Offset Project, 8 minimal row
#> prints 'Okay' to STDOUT.


> We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. 

Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.

The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.

The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?

We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.
