## Why article 6
Activities are set to grow
Carbon Credits under Art 6

## Glasgow

COP 26 is crucial for Art 6, because has two scenarios
Action overtakes ppolicy | Rainforces interest 

Operationalisation of Article 6.2 (Will be continue to developed)

# What is really means?

from one off demand to a liquid market

Country A | Country B | Country C | Country D|
Indistrialize few mitigigations options| could apply a mitigation credists| Domestic solutions| Reductions|

Diferent strategic could be apply for diferent countries, for example Coltax, other countries would be comply under Colombian Market

# What is the promise?

Big potential 

Article 6.2 mitigation activities | Articulo 6 readiness support

# Code
The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. 

As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

> It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. 


As governments step up efforts to strengthen the Paris Agreement at COP26 and tackle the climate emergency, corporate action has never been more critical.

As formalised into Article 5 of the Paris Agreement, the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) Mechanism was designed to "slow, halt and reverse forest cover and carbon loss" across an entire country, and now covers over 90% of the world's tropical forests. It has led to sequential declines in emissions, protected the world's rainforests over two decades, and is enshrined in the Paris Agreement. From April this year, corporations and investors have been able to purchase UNFCCC-verified, REDD+ carbon credits from the world's most fragile rainforests. 

# Unpacking Article 6

|Country A| Generation| Centralized route : Article 6.4 mechanism, and non-UN mechanisms|
|Country B| Transfer and Use | CDM (Projects and Programmes) and others|

|CDM|projects and CERS| Oportunity too Art 6.4 Crediting Mechanism|
|VCM|credits| Opportunity to Art 6.2 |

## Non-UN mechanisms
Differten types of crediting mechanisms can generate carbon assets
- Domesting credits mechanisms i.e., Quebec offset protocols
- International mechanism
- Independent carbon standard i.e., VCS and CCB

In another hand the advantages of the centralized sistem is cost of registering, now we have 100 parties (49.3% of the global emisision ) having comunicated GHG targets yhat cover all sectors of their economies.

However, we have several issues to resolve:

- Corresponding adjustments: is a simple sustration and addition trasnfer trought ITMOs from NDS emissions and must be made for the use of ITMO and other mechanisms as CORSIA.
