The purpose of [The Evolving Voluntary Carbon Market Paper](https://www.ieta.org/resources/Resources/Reports/The%20Evolving%20Voluntary%20Carbon%20Market_web.pdf) is to shed light on how the VCM is evolving. A group of IETA members have identified the issues and uncertainties that market players are experiencing due to the debate around the VCM and the ambitious role it can play. The Paper discusses a range of topics significantly impacting the market by dividing them into the following four sections:

• Section A: Corporate Net-zero Guidance and Inclusion of Offsetting

• Section B: The Relationship Between the VCM and Country Actions Under the Paris Agreement

• Section C: Consolidation or Proliferation of Crediting Approaches 

• Section D: Governance and Increasing Regulation
