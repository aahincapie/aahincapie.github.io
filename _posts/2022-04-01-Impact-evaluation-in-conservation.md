Methods
- Semiestructured interview
- Card execrcise

Suggestion
- "easy really true"
- There are multiples realities

If want to answer bigger questions sucha as nature based solutions have really impqact
Qualitative impacts 
Whos is the audiance

# Unpacking quantitative and qualitative evidence

When we says we can extrapolate the results, is important to recognize that we need undertand that the impacts apply in especific context, when specific condicitions.



| Results Chain Component | Description | Main Methods | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inputs | The resources required to implement the program. | Budget, staff, materials, equipment. | Quantitative |
| Activities | The specific actions taken to achieve program objectives. | Training sessions, workshops, field surveys, habitat restoration. | Qualitative |
| Outputs | The tangible products or services delivered as a result of program activities. | Number of participants trained, acres of habitat restored, species population size monitored. | Quantitative |
| Outcomes | The short-term and intermediate changes that occur as a result of program outputs. | Increased knowledge, improved skills, better habitat quality. | Qualitative |
| Impacts | The long-term changes in behavior, policy, or condition resulting from program outcomes. | Increased public support for conservation, improved policy frameworks, biodiversity conservation. | Qualitative |
