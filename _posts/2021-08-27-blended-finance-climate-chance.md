- Reducing carbon emissions to net zero is now as urgent as ever â€“ but so is adjusting to the hazards of a warming world.
- The new Landscape Resilience Fund with South Pole, WWF, GEF and Chanel uses blended finance to help communities most vulnerable to climate risks.
- Blended finance catalyses adaptation, manages risk and bridges the adaptation financing gap.

Here are four reasons why we use a blended finance approach:

## 1) Both private and public sectors benefit from investing in adaptation

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*


## 2) Blended finance allows for better risk management 

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.

## 3) Public finance is woefully insufficient to meet adaptation finance needs

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## 4) Blended finance can nudge the private sector to invest in adaptation

With so little time left and so much to gain, we need to learn about how to prepare for the colossal climate challenges that are yet to come. We hope our approach to public-private blended finance will inspire other multinational companies, development banks and climate funds to invest in protective measures that ensure the climate resilience of their supply chains and the global economy.
